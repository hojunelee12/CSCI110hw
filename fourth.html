<h1>Class about this semester</h1> 
<h2>CLASS!!</h2>

<p>I am taking CSCI110 which is very fun course, get to learn about the codings. I appreciate what I can learn from this course. However, main major is Commercial Aviation and 
	Aviation management which is very far from computer coding. I prefer to fly airplanes and instruct then playing with the computer. I was one of the people where 
	trouble shooting on the computer was knocking on the shell and plug the power code and out. Somehow, magically it worked, but I knew from before that wasn't 
	the correct way. So I am actually appreciating to learn more new materials. The only downside is that online classes make little harder to engage and has conflicting 
	time with the offline classes, but with the new technologies like Yuja enabled to learn consistently whenever and wherever. </p>
