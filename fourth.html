<h1>Class about this semester</h1> 
<h2>CLASS!!</h2>

<p>I am taking CSCI110 which is very fun course, get to learn about the codings. I appreciate what I can learn from this course. However, main major is Commercial Aviation and 
	Aviation management which is very far from computer coding. We deal with computers in airplane, however the 
	overall system is not taught as well since it is trade secret of companies who makes flight computers and instruments. It is actually very limited how really those 
	machines operate due to that. 
	That led to me the one option which I prefer to fly airplanes and instruct then playing with the computer. I was one of the people where 
	trouble shooting on the computer was knocking on the shell and plug the power code and out. Somehow, I do have to say magically it worked, but I knew from before that wasn't 
	the correct way. Most of the classes and flight courses that I took was to identify and verify the problem and trouble shoot before declaring an emergency which was 
	very far from just hitting at the computer. </p>

	From this class, Thomas Stokke is professor on CSCI110 which explains very well about the materials that we have to study and work on. However, I guess it is COVID-19 that 
	made everything challenging with the online requirements and in-class capacity requirements. I really hope that COVID-19 can be finally over and take more 
	classes offline. Also, that makes more flexibility to the schedule to my job where it is very limited due to COVID-19. It has been a year already when school shifted through 
	online settings where it makes sense to keep everybody safe. However, I just cannot wait to interact with people and classes when I move through my last half of senior year. UND 
	gave me so much more opportunities to learn.</p>
